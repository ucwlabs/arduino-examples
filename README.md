## ARDUINO EXAMPLES

The example projects for Arduino were created for the HackTheBase IoT Hub Lab.

The [HackTheBase IoT Hub Lab](https://hackthebase.com/iot-hub-lab) is a creative space dedicated to prototyping and inventing, 
all sorts of microcontrollers ([Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/feather), [Particle Boron](https://docs.particle.io/boron/), 
[ESP8266](https://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php), [ESP32](http://esp32.net/) and more) 
with various types of connectivity (WiFi, LoRaWAN, GSM, LTE-M), and tools such as screwdriver,
voltmeter, wirings, as well as an excellent program filled with meetups, workshops, 
and hackathons to the community members.
